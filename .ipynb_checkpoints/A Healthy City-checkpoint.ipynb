    "<a href=\"http://thecanadianfacts.org/the_canadian_facts.pdf\">Social determinants of health</a> (such as income and income distribution, education, unemployement, food insecurity, housing, race and many others) have been long known to have a major impact on health outcomes. However, these impacts are never obvious or clearly visualized in a day to day basis. In this project, I hope to show the effects of social determinants of health using clustering algorithms. I will cluster health outcome data to group toronto into different clusters. I will then use clustering algorithms on social determinants data. Overlapping these two clusters should show the effect of social determinants of health on health outcomes\n",

    "This clustering algorithm is a key tool for policy makers and public health workers. This allows us to see which parts of the city are not as healthy as others, and exactly what we can do about it. For example if it turns out as expected that education clusters well with health data, it can give policy makers the tool to figure out where to build the next school project. "
